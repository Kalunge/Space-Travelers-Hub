# Space-Travellers-Hub

Worked with the real live data from the SpaceX API. Our task was to build a web application for a company that provides commercial and scientific space travel services. The application allows users to book rockets and join selected space missions.
The Space Travelers' Hub consists of Rockets, Missions, and the My Profile section.
